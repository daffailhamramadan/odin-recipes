    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Learn how to make cap cai, a yummy Chinese-Indonesian vegetable dish that
      you'll find in restaurants all over Jakarta. It's a great pescetarian
      dish, too. We usually serve it with brown rice and fried tofu. You can
      leave out the prawns and the taste is still great, or even substitute for
      chicken.

          Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in
          garlic and onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned
          translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp, bok choy, broccoli,
          cauliflower, carrot, and green onion. Pour in water, cover, and cook
          until shrimp is no longer translucent in the center and vegetables are
          tender, about 15 minutes.
